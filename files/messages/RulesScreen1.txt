To manage your lemonade stand, you will need to make these decisions every day:
1. How many glasses of lemonade to make (only one batch is made each morning)
2. How many advertising signs to make (the signs will cost fifteen cents each)
3. What price to charge for each glass
You will begin with $2.00 cash (assets). Because your mother gave you some sugar, your cost to make lemonade is two cents a class (this may change in the future).
